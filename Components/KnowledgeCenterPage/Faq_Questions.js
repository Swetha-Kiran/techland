        summary:
          "Co-investment is a method in which several investors come together to pool in money to make an investment. The income or returns generated from this investment is then shared by the investors in proportion to their investment amounts. For example - 3 investors invest Rs 20,000 each to buy a single motorcycle worth Rs 60,000. Each investor will receive 1/3rd i.e. 20,000/60,000 of the returns generated by this motorcycle over the investment period. It can hence be said that each investor has a 1/3rd or 33.3% ownership of the motorcycle i.e. a fractional ownership.",
